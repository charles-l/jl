* bignum
* floating point
* JIT? (we want speedz)
* good low level coding
    * Probably gonna need structs...
    * Maybe use Go as inspiration for this?
        * Allow pointers, but no pointer arithmatic?
        * Or allow pointer arithmatic, but treat pointers as literal arrays i.e at least do bounds checking?
    * Optional GC?
    * Have wrapper to /bin/cc that compiles in place with C source (i.e. `jl compile *.l *.c`)
* build script dsl
* OpenGL lib
